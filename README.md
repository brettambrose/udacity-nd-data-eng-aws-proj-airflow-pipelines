## Project Summary
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## AWS PREREQUSITES
1. An AWS Account with an IAM User with the following permissions
    - AdminstratorAccess
    - AmazonRedshiftFullAccess
    - AmazonS3FullAccess
2. Local AWS CLI (download here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    - Local .aws file will need to be configured (see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-methods)

### Docker Desktop and Apache Airflow

This project uses Apache Airflow 2.5.1.  For more documentation on Apache Airflow go to https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.1/

1. Download docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. The [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file is in this repo, but can be downloaded if needed here:https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.1/docker-compose.yaml
3. Ensure a **.env** file is in a local copy of this repo, populated with the following:

<pre>
AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME=apache/airflow:2.5.1
AIRFLOW_UID=50000
</pre>

## Project Datasets

The following source datasets are used:

> s3://udacity-dend/log-data
>
>s3://udacity-dend/song_data

**NOTE** a JSON path metadata file needs to be used for /log-data

> s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json 

## Local AWS config and credenitals for devs
This repo assumes that there is a .aws file in the current user's home directory and there are two files within it: credentials and config.

Example:

C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws

C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config ... will need to be populated with your access key and secrets, and should look like:
<pre>
[default]
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOURAWSKEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOURAWSSECRET
</pre>

C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config ... will need to be configured with your specific AWS region, and a glue profile, and should look like:
<pre>
[default]
region = us-east-1

[profile Redshift]
role_arn = 
</pre>

## Initiating the Airflow Web Server

Ensure [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed before proceeding.

To bring up the entire app stack up, we use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/) as shown below

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Create admin credentials for the Airflow Web Server run the following command

```bash
docker-compose run airflow-worker airflow users create --role Admin --username admin --email admin --firstname admin --lastname admin --password admin
```

Then go to http://localhost:8080/ - this is default port for Airflow on a local machine and log in using the credentials created above

### Add AWS Credentials to Airflow

The same key and secret placed in [.aws/credentials](#local-aws-config-and-credenitals-for-devs) will also need to be placed in Airflow.

Go to the Airflow UI --> Admin --> Connections --> Add New Record (little blue plus sign)

Connection Type = "Amazon Web Services"

## Deploying AWS Infrastructure with Imperative Provisioning Script

1. Go to the [deploy](/deploy/) folder
2. run the [infra_deploy.py](/deploy/infra_deploy.py) script, which will use boto3 to...
    1. Create the IAM Role for Redshift service
    2. Attach S3 full access policy to S3 role
    3. Populate local ~/.aws/config with IAM Role ARN
    4. Create the Redshift cluster
    5. Configure ingress rules on default AWS Security Group for Airflow access
    6. Populate [dwh.cfg](/dwh.cfg) **DB_HOST** variable with the Redshift cluster endpoint
3. Run the [create_tables.py](/deploy/create_tables.py) script, which will create all tables in the DWH using the SQL statements in [ddl.py](/deploy/ddl.py)

### Add Redshift Connection to Airflow

With the **DB_HOST** variable populated in the [dwh.cfg](/dwh.cfg) file during the [Deploying AWS Infrastructure](#deploying-aws-infrastructure-with-iac) step (if not already present in the file), go to Airflow UI --> Admin --> Connections --> Add New Record

Connection Type = "Amazon Redshift"

Use the **DB** variables in [dwh.cfg](/dwh.cfg) to fill out the rest

## Running the DAG in Airflow

Now all the connections are set up, run the [sparkify_etl](/dags/sparkify_etl.py) DAG in airflow. 

Go to in https://localhost:8080/ --> DAGS --> scroll down to sparkify_etl DAG

![Airflow DAG page](/assets/2025-05-01%2007_43_10-DAGs%20-%20Airflow.png)

Run the DAG by selecting the RUN botton at the top right.  Review the DAG by going to "Graph" to track the execution visually.

Verify DAG Success by hovering over and clicking on tasks...

![DAG Success](/assets/2025-05-01%2008_13_29-sparkify_etl%20-%20DAG%20Success.png)

... and reviewing task logs
![Task Log](/assets/2025-05-01%2008_15_12-sparkify_etl%20-%20Task%20Logs.png)

## Decommissioning Docker and Redshift

Once the ETL DAG runs successfully, execute the following terminal command to shutdown the docker container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

Then run the [infra_decomm.py](/deploy/infra_decomm.py) scrip in the [deploy](/deploy/) folder to:
1. Delete the Redshift Cluster
2. Delete the IAM Role
